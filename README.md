# Phoneword
This is an application that interfaces metamask, webrtc and ipfs.

The goal is to:
* Allow for tokens and Ethereum to be sent during a video call
* This will later be bridged to IPFS
* This is the nodejs implementation of this project
* Users will be able to video conference and record video/audio into IPFS by storing a reference to the IPFS hash in the ethereum blockchain
* Implement a phone/identity/user registry in IPFS, and engage in onversations and other collaboration
* Register phonewords
* Dispute phoneword registration
